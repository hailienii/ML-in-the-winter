## Mixture model data generation
__maximax likelyhood__



data point is density plots, which have means

assuming sample is very close to population


Goal: get probibility of each data point belonging to which group, distribution
find the right set of pi s


- question: if we have overlap, how  could sum of pi is 1?

how to evaluate how good our guess on a given point is:
P(X|C) is the likelyhood of the data

pi is the prior probibility
