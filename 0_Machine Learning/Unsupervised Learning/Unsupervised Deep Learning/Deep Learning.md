(Unsupervised) Deep Learning 



1. what fundamental challenges of machine learning is deep learning is addressing, and how.

Deep Learning addresses critical components

o Universality Theorem (the correct functional form) 

• Any bounded and continuous function $f: R^N -> R^M$ , realized by a network with 1 hidden layer (with enough neurons) 



o Representation Learning (the correct features)

• Hidden layers compute intermediate representations optimized for correctly computing y=f(x)

​	Automatic feature reduction, transformation, amalgamation, etc.



2. Understand how deep learning methods learn and model hierarchies of representations.





3. how unsupervised deep learning is conducted, and argue why it is offers fundamentally different value than other forms of deep learning 

§ Know what these models are optimizing 





4. what are the main ideas of sparse coding and (stacked) autoencoders.









5. Be able to connect Unsupervised Deep Learning concepts to other unsupervised ideas discussed previously in the course, e.g., visualization, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.





6. Be able to argue about the various limitations of Deep Learning
