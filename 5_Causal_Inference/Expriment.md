Let's start our discussion of statistical power by recalling two definitions we learned when we first introduced to hypothesis testing:

- A **Type I error** occurs if we reject the null hypothesis *H*0 (in favor of the alternative hypothesis *HA*) when the null hypothesis *H*0 is true. We denote *α* = *P*(Type I Error).
- A **Type II error** occurs if we fail to reject the null hypothesis *H*0 when the alternative hypothesis *HA* is true. We denote *β* = *P*(Type II Error).

You'll certainly need to know these two definitions inside and out, as you'll be thinking about them a lot in this lesson, and at any time in the future when you need to calculate a sample size either for yourself or for someone else.
