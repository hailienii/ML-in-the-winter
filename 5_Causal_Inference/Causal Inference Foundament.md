Causal Inference



Prediction and causation are very different. 

Typical questions are: 

- Prediction: Predict Y after observing X = x 

- Causation: Predict Y after setting X = x. 

Causation involves predicting the effect of an intervention. For example:

Prediction: Predict health given that a person takes vitamin C 

Causation: Predict health if I give a person vitamin C



The difference between passively observing X = x and actively intervening and setting X = x is significant and requires different techniques and, typically, much stronger assumptions. This is the area known as causal inference.
