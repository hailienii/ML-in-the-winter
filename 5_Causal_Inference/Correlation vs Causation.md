# Correlation vs. Causation

## Threats to Causal Inference
Two clusters of threats: Selection and Endogeneity

### 1. Sample selection bias


### 2. Endogeneity


#### 2.1 Omitted variable bias


#### 2.2 Simultaneity bias 


#### 2.3 Measurement error

Note: Measurement error is dangerous to causal inference, but it is not necessarily true in prediction. 
In machine learning, sometimes, more variance, even noise of a variable can add more variety of the model, which can somehow make model more robust. (not generally proved)
