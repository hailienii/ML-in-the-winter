## Assumptions for the t-test

- Bivariate independent variable (A, B groups)

- Continuous dependent variable

- Each observation of the dependent variable is *independent* of the other observations of the dependent variable (its probability distribution isn't affected by their values). Exception: For the paired t-test, we only require that the pair-differences (Ai - Bi) be independent from each other (across i). 

  [Note: "independent" and "dependent" are used in two different senses here. Just think of a "dependent variable" as one thing, and "observations that are dependent" as another thing.]

- Dependent variable has a *normal distribution*, with the same variance, Ïƒ2, in each group (as though the distribution for group A were merely shifted over to become the distribution for group B, without changing shape):
