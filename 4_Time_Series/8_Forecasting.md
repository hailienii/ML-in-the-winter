Notice that 

(a) the one-step forecasts within the sample merely "shadow" the observed data, lagging exactly one period behind, and 

(b) the long-term forecasts outside the sample follow a horizontal straight line anchored on the last observed value. 

The error measures and residual randomness tests for this model are very much superior to those of the linear trend model, as will be seen below. However, the horizontal appearance of the long-term forecasts is rather unsatisfactory if we believe that the upward trend observed in the past is genuine.
